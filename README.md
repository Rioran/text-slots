At the beginning might take a while to load - wait for "welcome" to appear.

Push spin button to play.

Every spin costs 1 coin. Reload if you ran out of coins.

Only middle horizontal line plays. Every coin faced here brings you 1 coin. All other emojis in threes (🪙🎁💸💰💎👑🦄) grant goins progressively: 3, 7, 10, 13, 20, 40, and 100.

Game designed for player to loose 1.75% value across all spins on average: still entertaining but casino inevitably wins if played long enough.

Works on PC, android and iOS.
